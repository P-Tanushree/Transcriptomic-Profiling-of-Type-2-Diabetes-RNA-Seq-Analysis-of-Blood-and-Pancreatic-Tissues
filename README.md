# Transcriptomic-Profiling-of-Type-2-Diabetes-RNA-Seq-Analysis-of-Blood-and-Pancreatic-Tissues
This project explores the molecular landscape of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) by analyzing publicly available RNA-Seq data from blood and pancreatic tissues of healthy and T2D patients. Using bioinformatics pipelines, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified.
